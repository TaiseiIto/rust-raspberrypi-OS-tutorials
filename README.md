## â„¹ï¸ Introduction

This is a tutorial series for hobby OS developers who are new to ARM's 64 bit [ARMv8-A
architecture]. The tutorials will give a guided, step-by-step tour of how to write a [monolithic]
Operating System `kernel` for an `embedded system` from scratch. They cover implementation of common
Operating Systems tasks, like writing to the serial console, setting up virtual memory and handling
HW exceptions. All while leveraging `Rust`'s unique features to provide for safety and speed.

P.S.: Chinese :cn: versions of the tutorials were started by [@colachg] and [@readlnh]. You can find
them as [`README.CN.md`](README.CN.md) in the respective folders. They are a bit out-of-date at the
moment though.

## ğŸ“‘ Organization

- Each tutorial contains a stand-alone, bootable `kernel` binary.
- Še€–Ú‚Í“Æ—§‚µ‚½‹N“®‰Â”\‚Èkernel bynary‚ğŠÜ‚İ‚Ü‚·D
- Each new tutorial extends the previous one.
- V‚µ‚¢€–Ú‚Í‘O‚Ì€–Ú‚ÌŠg’£‚Å‚·D
- Each tutorial `README` will have a short `tl;dr` section giving a brief overview of the additions,
  and show the source code `diff` to the previous tutorial, so that you can conveniently inspect the
  changes/additions.
    - Some tutorials have a full-fledged, detailed text in addition to the `tl;dr` section. The
      long-term plan is that all tutorials get a full text, but for now this is exclusive to
      tutorials where I think that `tl;dr` and `diff` are not enough to get the idea.

- The code written in these tutorials supports and runs on the **Raspberry Pi 3** and the
  **Raspberry Pi 4**.
  - Tutorials 1 till 5 are groundwork code which only makes sense to run in `QEMU`.
  - Starting with [tutorial 5](05_drivers_gpio_uart), you can load and run the kernel on the real
    Raspberrys and observe output over `UART`.

- Although the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 are the main target boards, the code is written in a modular
  fashion which allows for easy porting to other CPU architectures and/or boards.

- In addition to the tutorial text, also check out the `make doc` command in each tutorial. It lets
  you browse the extensively documented code in a convenient way.

## ğŸ›  System Requirements

The tutorials are primarily targeted at **Linux**-based distributions. Most stuff will also work on
other Unix flavors such as **macOS**, but this is only _experimental_.

### ğŸš€ The tl;dr Version

1. [Install Docker][install_docker].
1. Ensure your user account is in the [docker group].
1. Prepare the `Rust` toolchain. Most of it will be handled on first use through the
   [rust-toolchain](rust-toolchain) file. What's left for us to do is:
   1. If you already have a version of Rust installed:
      ```bash
      cargo install cargo-binutils rustfilt
      ```

   1. If you need to install Rust from scratch:
      ```bash
      curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

      source $HOME/.cargo/env
      cargo install cargo-binutils rustfilt
      ```

1. In case you use `Visual Studio Code`, I strongly recommend installing the [Rust Analyzer extension].
1. If you are **NOT** running Linux, some `Ruby` gems are needed as well:

   ```bash
   sudo gem install bundler
   bundle config set path '.vendor/bundle'
   bundle install
   ```

### ğŸ§° More Details: Eliminating Toolchain Hassle

This series tries to put a strong focus on user friendliness. Therefore, efforts were made to
eliminate the biggest painpoint in embedded development as much as possible: `Toolchain hassle`.

Rust itself is already helping a lot in that regard, because it has built-in support for
cross-compilation. All that we need for cross-compiling from an `x86` host to the Raspberry Pi's
`AArch64` architecture will be automatically installed by `rustup`. However, besides the Rust
compiler, we will use some more tools. Among others:

- `QEMU` to emulate our kernel on the host system.
- A self-made tool called `Minipush` to load a kernel onto the Raspberry Pi on-demand over `UART`.
- `OpenOCD` and `GDB` for debugging on the target.

There is a lot that can go wrong while installing and/or compiling the correct version of each tool
on your host machine. For example, your distribution might not provide the latest version that is
needed. Or you are missing some hard-to-get dependencies for the compilation of one of these tools.

This is why we will make use of [Docker][install_docker] whenever possible. We are providing an
accompanying container that has all the needed tools or dependencies pre-installed, and it gets
pulled in automagically once it is needed. If you want to know more about Docker and peek at the
provided container, please refer to the repository's [docker](docker) folder.

## ğŸ“Ÿ USB Serial Output

Since the kernel developed in the tutorials runs on the real hardware, it is highly recommended to
get a USB serial cable to get the full experience.

- You can find USB-to-serial cables that should work right away at [\[1\]] [\[2\]], but many others
  will work too. Ideally, your cable is based on the `CP2102` chip.
- You connect it to `GND` and GPIO pins `14/15` as shown below.
- [Tutorial 5](05_drivers_gpio_uart) is the first where you can use it. Check it out for
  instructions on how to prepare the SD card to boot your self-made kernel from it.
- Starting with [tutorial 6](06_uart_chainloader), booting kernels on your Raspberry is getting
  _really_ comfortable. In this tutorial, a so-called `chainloader` is developed, which will be the
  last file you need to manually copy on the SD card for a while. It will enable you to load the
  tutorial kernels during boot on demand over `UART`.
